### For contributors

This folder has *symbolic links* to
the ```data/```, ```code/```, and ```images/```
folders. This will prevent any conflicts
when pushing code from these folders up
to the index.ipynb. ***DO NOT*** refer
to files in these folders by calling them
at `../data/` or any permutation thereof.

Contributors will have to unzip the zipped
file `im.db.zip` to a folder named `unzipped`
or the calls to the imdb database will not work.
